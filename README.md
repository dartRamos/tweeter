# 🐦 Tweeter Project 🐦

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## 📌 How it works! 📌

* Begin by writing a tweet in the tweet box and clicking on "Tweet".
* After submitting the tweet it will appear below with the other tweets.
* And error message will appear if you exceed the character limit or if you leave the tweet box blank. If you are   worried you might go over the charater limit don't worry, our handle character counter will help you along the way.
* Once you correct your error the message will smoothly exit stage up!
